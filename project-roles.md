Understanding variable roles in code has been found to be helpful by students
in learning programming -- could variable roles help deep neural models in
performing coding tasks? We do an exploratory study:

- Analyzed the impact of an unsupervised feature enrichment approach based on
  variable roles on the performance of neural models of code.  
- Investigated the potential benefits of Sajaniemi et al.'s programming
  education concept of variable roles, in enhancing neural models of code.  
- Conducted the first study to analyze how variable role enrichment affects the
  training of the Code2Seq model. 
- Enriched a source code dataset by annotating the roles of individual
  variables, examining its impact on model training.  
- Identified challenges and opportunities in feature enrichment for neural code
  intelligence models.
