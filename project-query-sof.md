Besides being useful for software developers, annotated Stack Overflow snippets
can potentially serve as the basis for automated tools that provide working
code solutions to specific natural language queries.  Towards this goal, we
investigated the compilability of Stack Overflow code snippets. A total of 3
million code snippets were analyzed across four languages: C\#, Java,
JavaScript, and Python. Python and JavaScript proved to be the languages for
which the most code snippets are usable. Conversely, Java and C\# proved to be
the languages with the lowest usability rate.

- Compiled 300,000+ StackOverflow Java snippets. Designed and implemented automatic repair heuristics to improve their parse rate from 6.22% to 19.24%.
- Accepted in [13th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) 2016](http://2016.msrconf.org/#/home), Austin, Texas.
