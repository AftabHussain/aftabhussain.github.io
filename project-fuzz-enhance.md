Designing and building techniques for improving the effectiveness and
efficiency of fuzzing (automated random testing at scale) of parser and
compiler libraries, image processors, and other important software tools that
are used in billions of devices world-wide. By leveraging modern fuzzers like
Google's AFL, we aim to improve vulnerability detection and triaging.
