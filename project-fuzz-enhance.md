Designing and building techniques for improving the effectiveness and
efficiency of fuzzing (automated random testing at scale) of parser and
compiler libraries, image processors, and other important software tools that
are used in billions of devices world-wide. By leveraging modern fuzzers like
Google's AFL, we aim to improve vulnerability detection and triaging.

### DIAR: Removing Uninteresting Bytes in Software Fuzzing

- Developed a test reduction technique in Python for faster and more effective bug detection in widely used software libraries.
- Accepted in [IEEE International Conference on Software Testing Verification and Validation Workshop, ICSTW 2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9787917/proceeding)
